## Introduction

The [OSG-HTC School](https://osg-htc.org/school-2025/) is a week long summer school held in Madison, Wisconsin at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is focused around High Throughput Computing (HTC) and how to apply this technique to tons of different research problems. Lots of research boils down to doing a lot of analysis with large datasets and HTC can help with this. 


## My Project

I have already built a pipeline where I provide some parameters and the pipeline creates data given those parameters. Then I train an ML model on this data. Then this model is used to create initial guesses for an iterative solver. While this involves a little bit of manual operation in changing file names and the like throughout the steps, it is fairly automated. The main crux of what I need to do to progress on this project is to test over 5000 different parameter combinations and examine how well the CurrNN system works under various circumstances. This made my project a perfect candidate for conversion to an HTC style system. 

It has taken some time to convert my work to fit into the HTCondor system but I was able to get a good portion of the datageneration step set up during the week long school. It was made much easier by having the amazing CHTC staff avaliable to answer questiosn and help me get through this process. Especially important was getting the MATLAB code to compile correctly. This also involved me learning about how to use containers through apptainer and docker and effectively install what I am interested in using without sending too large of a container to each exectue point.

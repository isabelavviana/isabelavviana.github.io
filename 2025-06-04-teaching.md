## Introduction

### Classes

During my first year of grad school, I took 6 classes in total. These were Mathematical Analysis, Linear Algebra, Scientific Computing, Applied Numerical Methods, Real Analysis, and a Data Science course. It was quite jarring going from the slower paced style of learning in undergrad where you were often given the information needed to succeed in class much easily. During my graduate courses, I was expected to study much more on my own, practice much more on my own, and pay much more attention. This is not surprising since the classes are harder just based on the more advanced content, but diving into it did require some effort to stay afloat. 

I have always found analysis as a subject quite interesting and my graduate courses were no exception. I felt that the real analysis course in particular was so incredible because the abstraction felt purposeful and not simply a way to make things more crazy. My research will rely on a deep understanding of Functional Analysis and possibly Complex Analysis and I am very very excited to one day take those courses and use them to solve interesting problems.

My research is focsed on numerical analysis and scientific computing so both Scientific Computing and Applied Numerical Methods I also found very fun. In the second course, I got to do a few projects where I actually implemented the algorithms we spoke about in class like Finite Difference and Finite Elements. This actually inspired me to start doing so on my own time and I will start working on personal projects related to Numerical Methods. I quite look forward to taking more classes on the subjects and learning as much as I can. 

### Teaching

I was a TA for PreCalc and for Calc 1 during my first year. During high school, I got the chance to be a Learning Assistant for Calc 2 at FAU. I spent 2 years doing this. In addition, I privately tutor students in my own time. The combination of these two has given me a lot of training on how to 'teach' to students and showcase different methods to solve a problem. I really appreciate these skills since I have seen how many different mathematical backgrounds people come into these classes with. 

This year I did spend a lot more time grading and doing administrative things that I had expected. This is entirely a lack of proper time management at points but also a lack of true expectation management. Over time however, I got a lot better at planning ahead and understanding how to partion grading or how to get things done that need to get done in regards to teaching.

One thing that I am still learning to do is how to juggle teaching with classes with research with having a personal life with proper sleep. I think that this is something every graduate student deals with to some extent and I am sure I can figure it out but I do feel that there are points where it is overwhelming. I guess the skill just comes with practice and I am getting my fair share of that. I do feel that come fall, I will be way more prepared for success than I was coming into my first fall.


### Overall

Overall, this was a great year. I made a good deal of friends and am very happy I am able to succeed where I am like I have been. I look forward to the rest of summer and the start of the next school year.
